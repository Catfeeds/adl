# ADL
The skill, which named 'Activities of Daily Life(ADL)' is used to monitor the behavior of depression patients and help them become better. On the one hand, it records what patients said or done during a day and night, and then turns them into some intents as the interaction models requires. On the other hand, we build a third web service that receive  this data, and then feed back to the patients some cheerful words corresponding to what they have done. However, what's more important,  is this service can analyze the behaviors a patient provides and check if he is recovering well or not, which is able to offer some helpful information to psychologist for controlling the patientsâ€™ condition.
